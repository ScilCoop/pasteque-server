How to test Pasteque
====================

You must have phpunit installed. Then copy config-sample.php to config.php and
set it to point to an empty test database.

Run full tests by calling phpunit in the test directory without arguments.
$ phpunit
It will get tests from phpunit.xml and execute them.

To run a particular test suite name it in command line
$ phpunit services
will run only the test suite as defined in phpunit.xml
