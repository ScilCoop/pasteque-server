How to test Pasteque
====================

You must have phpunit installed. Then copy config-sample.php to config.php and
set it to point to an empty test database.

Run full tests by calling testall.sh in the test directory.

Tests are broken into thematic parts which can be found in the suites directory.
To run a particular theme run the followin command:
$ phpunit -c suites/<xml file>

You can run a single test by calling it with phpunit
$ phpunit <directory>/<test file>
Be sure the database is in the good state to begin the tests. Use the pseudo
test clear.php and install.php to erase/set up the database. These init/destroy
scripts are automatically run in the test suites.
$ phpunit clear.php
$ phpunit install.php
